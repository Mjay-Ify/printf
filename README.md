PARTNER 1 and 2 is here

the printf function is used in the C programming language (and in many other programming languages that have borrowed this function) to produce formatted output. It stands for "print formatted," and it allows you to display data on the screen or write it to a file with specific formatting.

The printf function takes a format string as its argument, which is a string that contains plain text as well as format specifiers. Format specifiers are placeholders that specify how the data should be formatted and where it should be inserted into the output. When you call printf, it processes the format string and any additional arguments and produces output according to the format specifiers.

The aim of this project is to understand the concept of printf and teamwork and thw project was done by Maryjane and Ademola.We are to make a custom printf
A custom printf function is a user-defined implementation of the printf-like functionality in a programming language, typically inspired by the standard printf function found in the C programming language. This custom function is created to provide formatted text output in a manner similar to the standard printf, but with potential variations or customizations to suit specific needs or constraints.

The standard printf function in C allows for formatted output by accepting a format string and a variable number of arguments. It uses format specifiers within the string to control how data should be formatted and displayed. For example, %d is a format specifier used to print integers, %s for strings, and so on.

A custom printf function would typically do the following:

Accept a format string: This is the string that defines the desired format of the output.

Accept a variable number of arguments: These are the values that will be inserted into the format string based on the format specifiers.

Parse the format string: The custom printf function would need to scan the format string for format specifiers (e.g., %d, %s) and process them accordingly.

Format and output: It would format the arguments according to the format specifiers and display or write the resulting text to the desired output location (e.g., the console, a file, or a buffer).
